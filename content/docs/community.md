## 什么是 OpenZipkin?

OpenZipkin 是 OSS 组织 Zipkin 代码，文档，规范和支持的管家.
它包括 GitHub 的项目, 本网站, 谷歌组 - 邮件列表, 推特和 gitter.

## 保持最新版本

Follow @zipkinproject on Twitter for news including release announcements and community events. You can also ask on gitter about something specific. If you are working on code, you can also follow projects like the server or an instrumentation you use.

## 作为社会的积极参与

OpenZipkin is primarily volunteers, and there are a lot of ways to help. Once you are on gitter, you might notice others asking questions you once asked. A great way to give-back is to help others who are just starting. We are at a number of events, and these are a great way to meet others you collaborate with. You can also host your own Zipkin meetup, similar to how our Tokyo user group started. If you notice something interesting on Twitter, tag it with #zipkin so that others can see it. Last, but not least, you can get involved with the code, docs and project maintenance.

## 如何改变基普金工作

Most OpenZipkin efforts start as localized experiments, then progressively build traction before becoming a feature. Before you start a large effort, be it docs or a test framework or a feature, check with one of the above channels. Someone may already have worked on this in the past and might join your effort. Sometimes, features are intentionally absent, usually with rationale documented in an issue. Regardless, the best advice is to join the community before proposing change, and read one of our HACKING files which explains important aspects of change culture.
